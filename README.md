# Data Pipelines Examples
## Project Summary 

##### This project is a respository of different types of data pipeline examples. There will be examples of different I/O operations like reading from databases, reading from APIs, writing to databases. There is no standard naming convention for file names yet. However, the file name will have alot of information about the pipeline itself. 

##### These are mostly for Apache Spark and specficially Databricks. But there is some Airflow and some GSheet stuff. The titles of the files try to be descriptive but it's usually worth opening them up to check them out to see exatly what they are doing. 

### Miscellaneous organization
##### There are only notebooks and DAGs as of now. But DAG and notebook are not necessarily correlated. These could be standalone jobs/pipelines or they could be things that are pieces of larger pipelines.
- Databricks notebooks
  - Python
  - Scala
  - SQL
- DAGs (Could be Airlfow or Dataswarm)
  - Python
