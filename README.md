# Data Pipelines Examples
## Project Summary 

This project is essentially a collection of different examples of data pipelines. There will be examples of different I/O operations like reading from databases, reading from APIs, writing to databases. There is no standard naming convention for file names yet. However, the file name will have a lot of information about the pipeline itself. 

These are mostly for Apache Spark and specifically Databricks. But there is some Airflow and some GSheet stuff. The titles of the files try to be descriptive but it's usually worth opening them up to check them out to see exatly what they are doing. 

### Miscellaneous organization

There are only notebooks and DAGs as of now. Also, DAGs and notebooks are not necessarily correlated. These could be standalone jobs/pipelines - or they could be pieces of larger pipelines.
