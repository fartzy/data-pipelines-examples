# Data Pipelines Examples
#### These are mostly on spark and specficially databricks.  The titles of the files try to be descriptive but it's usually worth opening them up to check them out to see exatly what they are doing. 

### Miscellaneous organization
##### There are notebooks and DAGs as of now but the DAG and notebook are not necessarily correlated. These could be standalone jobs/pipelines or they could be things that are pieces of larger pipelines.
